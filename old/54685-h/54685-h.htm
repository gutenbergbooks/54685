    <h2>
      CHAPTER I&mdash;BELL WINSHIP's EXPERIMENT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ARCH had come in
      like a lion, and showed no sign of going out like a lamb. The pussy
      willows knew that it was, or ought to be, spring, but although it takes a
      deal to discourage a New England pussy willow, they shivered in their
      brown skins and despaired of making their annual appearance even by April
      Fool's Hay. The swallows still lingered in the South, having received
      private advices from the snow-birds that State o' Maine weather, in the
      present season, was only fitted for Arctic explorers. The air was keen and
      nipping and the wind blew steadily from the north and howled about the
      chimneys until one hardly knew whether to hug the warmth of the open fire
      or to go out and battle with the elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little did the rosy girls of the Wareham Female Seminary (girls were still
      &ldquo;young females&rdquo; when all this happened)&mdash;little did they care about
      snow and sleet and ice. Studies went on all the better with the afternoon
      skating and sliding to look forward to. What joy to perch in the
      window-seat with your volume of Virgil, and translate &ldquo;<i>Hoc opus hic
      labor est</i>&rdquo; with half an eye on the gleaming ice of the pond, or the
      glittering crust of the hillsides! What fun to slip on your rubber boots,
      muffle yourself in your warm coat (made out of mother's old mink cape),
      and run across the way to the Academy for recitations in mathematics or
      philosophy!
    </p>
    <p>
      These joys, however, with their attendant responsibilities, duties, and
      cares, were to be suspended for a while at the Wareham Seminary, and the
      &ldquo;young females&rdquo; who graced that institution of learning were not
      inconsolable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bell Winship, an uncommonly nice girl herself and a born leader of other
      nice girls, had sent out five mysteriously worded notes that morning, five
      little notes to as many little maids, requesting the honor of their
      presence at ten a. m. precisely, in Number 27, Second floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where Bell Winship wished girls to be, there they always were, and on the
      minute, too, lest they should miss something; so there is nothing
      remarkable in this statement of the fact, that at ten o'clock in the
      morning, Number 27, Second floor, of the Wareham Female Seminary seemed to
      be overflowing with girls, although in reality there were but six, all
      told.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wildest curiosity prevailed, and it was very imperfectly controlled,
      but, at length, the hostess, mounting a shoebox, spoke with great dignity
      in these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fellow-countrywomen: Whereas, our recitation-hall has been burned to the
      ground, thereby giving us a well-earned vacation of two weeks, I wish to
      impart to you a plan by which we can better resign ourselves to the
      afflicting and mysterious dispensation. You are aware,&rdquo; she continued,
      still impressively, &ldquo;that my highly respected parents are both away for
      the winter, thus leaving our humble cottage closed, and it occurred to me
      as a brilliant, if somewhat daring, idea, that we six girls should go over
      and keep house in it for a fortnight, alone and untrammeled.&rdquo; Here the
      tidal wave of her eloquence was impeded by the overmastering enthusiasm of
      the audience. Cheers and applause greeted her. Everybody pounded with
      whatever she chanced to have in her hand, on any article of furniture that
      chanced to be near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Bell, Bell! what a lovely plan!&rdquo; cried Lilia Porter; &ldquo;a more than
      usually lovely plan; but will your mother ever allow it, do you suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the point,&rdquo; answered Bell, gleefully. &ldquo;Here is the letter I have
      just received from my father; he is a good parent, wholly worthy of his
      daughter:&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Baltimore, March 6th, 18&mdash;.

     My dear Child:&mdash;We do not like to refuse you anything while
     we are away enjoying ourselves, so, as the house is well
     insured, you may go over and try your scheme. Your mother
     says that you must not entirely demolish her jelly and
     preserves. My only wish is that you will be careful of the
     fires and lights.

     I hope you won't feel injured if I suggest your asking
     advice and suggestion of Miss Miranda and Miss Jane, who are
     your nearest neighbors. They will take you in charge anyway,
     and you might as well put yourself nominally under their
     care. Your uncle will, of course, have an eye to you,
     perhaps two eyes, and I dare say he could use more than the
     allotted number, but Grandmamma will lend him hers, no
     doubt.

     Write me a line every day, saying that the household timbers
     are still standing.

     Your weakly indulgent but affectionate

     Father.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't he a perfect darling!&rdquo; cried the enraptured quintette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said demure Patty Weld, &ldquo;that before we permit ourselves to
      feel too happy, we had better consult <i>our</i> 'powers that be,' and see
      if we can accept Bell's invitation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I refuse to hear 'No' from one of you,&rdquo; Bell answered, firmly. &ldquo;I have
      thought it all over; spent the night upon it, in fact. You, Alice, and
      Josie Fenton, are too far from home to go there anyway, so I shall lead
      you off as helpless captives. Your mother is in town, Lilia, so that you
      can ask her immediately, and hear the worst; you and Edith, Patty, are
      only a half-day's journey away, and can find out easily. I know you can
      get permission, for it's going to be perfectly proper and safe. Grandmamma
      lives nearby, the Sawyer spinsters are the village duennas, and Uncle
      Harry can protect us from any rampaging burglars and midnight marauders
      that may happen in to pay their respects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the &ldquo;Jolly Six,&rdquo; as they were called by their schoolmates, separated,
      to build many castles in the air. Bell, it was decided, was to go on to
      her country home in advance, and, with the help of a neighboring farmer's
      daughter, prepare and provision the house for an unusual siege.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls had determined to have no servant, and their many ingenious
      plans for managing and dividing the work were the source of great
      amusement to the teachers, some of whom had been admitted to their
      confidence. Josie Fenton and Bell were to do the cooking, Jo claiming the
      sternly practical department best suited to her&mdash;meat, vegetables,
      and bread&mdash;while Bell was to concoct puddings, cakes, and the various
      little indigestible dainties toward which schoolgirl hearts are so tender.
      Alice Forsaith, the oldest of the party and the beauty of the school, with
      Edith Lambert, as an aid, was to manage the making of the beds, tidying of
      rooms, and setting of tables, while Lilia Porter and Patty Weld, with
      noble heroism and selfsacrifice, offered to shoulder that cross of an
      old-fashioned girl's life&mdash;the washing and wiping of dishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a Wednesday morning the two maiden ladies living nearly opposite the
      Winship cottage were transfixed with wonder by the appearance of Bell, who
      asked for the house-key left in safe keeping with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Du tell, Isabel!&mdash;I didn't expect to see you this mornin',&mdash;air
      your folks comin' home or hev you been turned out o' school?&rdquo; asked Miss
      Miranda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; laughed Bell; &ldquo;I'm going to housekeeping myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good land! You haven't run off and got married, have you?&rdquo; cried Miss
      Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite so bad as that; but I'm going to bring five of my schoolmates
      over to-morrow, and we intend to stay here two weeks all alone, as
      housekeepers and householders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Land o' mercy,&rdquo; moaned the nervous Miss Miranda. &ldquo;That Pa o' yourn would
      let you tread on him and not notice it. How any sensible man could do sech
      a crazy thing as to let a pack of girls tear his house to pieces, I don't
      see. You'll burn us all up before a week's out; I declare I sha'n't sleep
      a wink for worrying the whole time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't be afraid, Miss Sawyer,&rdquo; said Bell, with some spirit. &ldquo;If six
      girls, none of them younger than fourteen, can't take care of a few stoves
      and fireplaces, I should think it was a pity. Everybody seems to think
      nowadays that young people have no common sense. The world's growing wiser
      all the time, and I don't see why we shouldn't be as bright as those
      detestable pattern-girls of fifty years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, don't get huffy, Isabel; you mean well, but all girls are
      unstiddy at your age. Anyhow, I'll try to keep an eye on ye. Here's your
      key, and we can spare you a quart of milk a day and risin's for your
      bread, if you're going to try riz bread, though I don't s'pose one of ye
      knows anything about flour food.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you; that'll be very nice, and now I'm going over to begin work,
      for I have heaps to do. Emma Jane Perkins has come to help me, and
      Grandma's Betty will come down every afternoon. By the way, can I have
      Topsycat while I am here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I s'pose so,&rdquo; said Miss Jane, &ldquo;though it's been an awful sight of
      work gettin' her used to our ways, and I'd never have done it if Mis'
      Winship hadn't set such store by her. She pretty near pined away the first
      week, and I've baked ginger cake for her and buttered her fritters every
      mornin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't borrow her if you think she will be more troublesome afterward,&rdquo;
       Bell answered, &ldquo;but you know it's almost impossible to keep house without
      a cat and a dog. Bobs came over from Uncle Harry's the moment I arrived,
      and is waiting at the gate now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't agree with you,&rdquo; said Miss Miranda. &ldquo;'Blessed be nothin', I say,
      when it comes to live stock. We disposed of our horse, the pig went next,
      and the cow's turn's comin'. Even a cat is dreadful confinin'. If you have
      a cat and two hens you're as much tied down as if you had a barn full of
      critters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The day was very cold, and both Bell and Emma Jane shivered as they
      unlocked one frost-bitten door after another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall freeze as stiff as pokers,&rdquo; said Bell, with chattering teeth;
      &ldquo;but we can't help it; let's build a fire in every stove in the honse and
      thaw things out.&rdquo; This was done, and in an hour they were moderately
      comfortable. The weather being so cold, Bell decided upon using only three
      rooms, all on the first floor&mdash;the large, handsome family
      sitting-room, the kitchen, and Mrs. Win-ship's chamber. This being very
      capacious, she moved a couple of bedsteads from other rooms, and placing
      the three side by side, filled up the intervening spaces with bolsters,
      thus making one immensely wide bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Emma Jane, isn't that a bright idea! We can all sleep in a row,
      and then there'll be no quarreling about bedfellows or rooms. I certainly
      am a good contriver,&rdquo; cried Bell, with a triumphant little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks awful like a hospital, and the bolsters will keep fallin' down
      in between and it'll be dreadful hard mak-in' 'em up of a mornin',&rdquo;
       rejoined Emma Jane, who was no flatterer, being New England born and bred.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sitting-room coal stove had accommodations, on top and back, for
      cooking, so Bell thought that their suppers, with perhaps an occasional
      breakfast, might be prepared there. The large bay-window, with its bright
      drugget, would serve as a sort of tiny diningroom, so the mahogany
      extension-table, with its carved legs, pretty red cover, and silver
      service, was carried there. This accomplished, and every room made
      graceful and attractive by Bell (who was a born homemaker, and placed
      photographs, lamps, sofa-pillows, fir-boughs, and bowls of red apples just
      where they were needed in the picture), she went over to her
      Grandmother's, where four loaves of bread were baking and pies being
      filled, in order that the young housekeepers might begin with a full
      pantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Grandma,&rdquo; she exclaimed breathlessly, tearing off her cloud and
      bringing down with it a sunshiny mass of bronze hair, &ldquo;it does look
      lovely, if I do say it; and as for setting that house on fire, there's no
      danger, for it will take a week to thaw it into a state in which it would
      burn. I have made up my mind that I sha'n't be the one to build the fires
      every morning, even if I am hostess. I don't want to freeze myself daily
      for the cause of politeness. Has the provision man come yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Uncle Harry, &ldquo;and brought eatables enough for an army&mdash;more
      than you girls can devour in a month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll see,&rdquo; said Bell, laughingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know the capacity of the 'Jolly Six' yet. Now, Betty, please
      take the eggs and potatoes and fish and put them in our store room. I've
      just time to make my cake and custard before I drive to the station for
      the girls. Do you know, Uncle Harry, I am going to do the most astounding
      thing! I've borrowed Farmer Allen's one-seated old pung,&mdash;the one he
      takes to town filled with vegetables,&mdash;and I am going to keep it for
      our sleigh-rides. It will hold all six of us, and what do we care for
      public opinion!&rdquo; said she, with a disdainful gesture.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II&mdash;IN THE FIRELIGHT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>WO hours later you
      might have seen the old pung drawn by Mr. Allen's Jerry, with Bell and
      Alice Forsaith on the seat, and four laughing, rosy-cheeked girls warmly
      tucked in buffalo robes on the bottom. Even the sober old sun, who had
      been under a cloud that day, poked his head out to see the fun, and became
      so interested that, in spite of himself, he forgot his determination not
      to shine, and did his duty all the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the girls opened the door and saw Bell's preparations,&mdash;the cozy
      sitting-room, with dining-table in the bay-window, three sofas in a row,
      so that on snowy days they might extend their lazy lengths thereon, and
      finally a fir-covered barrel of Nodhead and Baldwin apples in one corner,&mdash;there
      arose bursts of happy laughter and ecstatic cheers loud enough to shock
      the neighbors, who seldom laughed and never cheered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it's an original idea to have an apple-barrel in your parlor
      corner,&rdquo; said Bell; &ldquo;but the common-sense of it will be seen by every
      thoughtful mind. Our forces will consume a peck a day, and life is too
      short to spend it in galloping up and down cellar constantly for apples.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bell Winship, you are an inhospitable creature,&rdquo; exclaimed Lilia Porter.
      &ldquo;Here I am, calmly seated on a coal-hod with my hat on, while you are
      talking so fast that you can't get time to show us our apartments. Shelter
      before food, say I!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apartments!&rdquo; sniffed Bell, in mock dudgeon. &ldquo;You are very grand in your
      ideas! Behold your camp, your wigwam, your tent, your quarters!&rdquo; and she
      threw open the door of the large chamber and waved the party dramatically
      in that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bell, you will yet be Presidentess of these United States,&rdquo; cried Edith
      Lambert. &ldquo;Any girl who can devise two such happy combinations as an
      apple-barrel in a parlor corner and three beds in a row, ought to be given
      a chair of state.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might a poor worm inquire, Bell,&rdquo; asked Patty, &ldquo;why those croquet mallets
      and balls are laid out in file round the beds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, those are for protection, you goose, supposing anybody should come
      in the piazza window at night, and we had nothing to kill him with!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and supposing he should take one of the mallets and pound us all to
      a jelly to begin with?&rdquo; Patty retorted, being of a practical mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That <i>would</i> be rather embarrassing,&rdquo; answered Bell, with a
      reflective shudder; &ldquo;I hadn't thought of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What could one poor man do against five girls banging him with croquet
      mallets, while the sixth was running to alarm the neighbors?&rdquo; asked Alice,
      &ldquo;and to put an end to the discussion I suggest that the cooks start
      supper;&rdquo; whereupon she threw herself into an arm-chair, and put up a pair
      of small, stout boots on the fender.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unfortunate couple referred to exchanged looks of unmitigated
      discouragement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have my opinion of a girl who will mention supper before she has been
      in the house an hour,&rdquo; said the head cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Josie, I foresee that they are going to make galley-slaves of us if they
      can. However,&rdquo; turning again to Alice, &ldquo;it isn't to be supper, but dinner.
      The meals at this house are to be thus and so: Breakfast at 9 a.m.,
      luncheon at 12 m., dinner at 5 p.m., refreshments at various times betwixt
      and between, and all affairs pertaining to eatables are to be completely
      under the control of the chefs, Mesdemoiselles Winship and Fenton. We
      cannot have you 'suggesting' dinner at all hours, Miss Forsaith. If time
      hangs heavy on your hands, occupy it in your own branches of housework.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we are to be ruled over in this way, life will not be worth living,&rdquo;
       cried Patty Weld, in comical despair. &ldquo;I dare say we shall be half starved
      as the days go on, but do give us something good to begin on, Bluebell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judging from the scene at the table an hour later, it would not have made
      much difference whether the repast was sumptuous or not, so formidable
      were the appetites, and such the merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear,&rdquo; sighed Bell, dismally, to the assistant cook, &ldquo;I will throw
      off all disguise and say that this family is a surprise and a
      disappointment to me. When a person cooks twenty-seven potatoes, with the
      reasonable expectation of having half left to fry, and sees a solitary one
      left in the dish, with all its lovely companions both faded and gone, she
      is naturally disheartened. Any way, we have finished for to-night, so the
      Dish Brigade can marshal its forces. We will take our one potato into the
      kitchen, Jo, and see if we can make it enough for breakfast. Look in the
      corner bookcase; bring Mrs. Whitney's 'Just How,' Marion Harland's 'Cook
      Book,' 'The Young Housekeeper's Friend,' and 'The Bride's Manual.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At nine o'clock that evening Uncle Harry passed through the garden, and
      noticing a pair of open shutters, peeped in at the back window of the
      sitting-room, thinking he had never seen a more charming or attractive
      picture. Pretty Edith Lambert was curled up in an armchair near the astral
      lamp, her face resting on her two rosy palms, and her eyes bent over
      &ldquo;Little Women.&rdquo; Bluebell, her bright hair bobbed in a funny sort of twist,
      from which two or three venturesome and rebellious curls were straying
      out, and her high-necked blue apron still on over her dark dress, was
      humming soft little songs at the piano. Roguish Jo was sitting flat on the
      hearth, her bright cheeks flushed rosier under the warm occupation of corn
      popping, and her dark hair falling loosely round her face, while Patty
      Weld with her shy, demure face, was beside her on a hassock, knitting a
      &ldquo;fascinator&rdquo; out of white wool. These two, so thoroughly unlike, were
      never to be seen apart; indeed, they were so inseparable as to be dubbed
      the &ldquo;Scissors&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tongs&rdquo; by their friends. Alice and Lilia were
      quarreling briskly over a game of cribbage, Lilia's animated expression
      and ringing laugh contrasting forcibly with the calm face of her
      antagonist. Alice was never known to be excited over anything. It was she
      who carried off all the dignity and took the part of presiding goddess of
      the party. The girls all adored her for her beauty and superior age; for
      she had attained the enviable pinnacle of &ldquo;sweet sixteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Jo, breaking the silence, &ldquo;let us have refreshments, then a
      good quiet talk together, then muster the Hair-Brushing Brigade, and go to
      bed. I think I have corn enough; I've popped and popped and popped as no
      one ever popped before, and till popping has ceased to be fun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pop on, pop ever; the more you give us, Jo, the more popular you'll be,&rdquo;
       laughed Bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a veritable 'pop-in-J,' isn't she?&rdquo; cried Lilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now Lilia,&rdquo; said Edith, &ldquo;let us get the apples and nuts, and we'll sit in
      a ring on the floor, and eat. I shan't crack the almonds; the girl that
      hath her teeth, I say, is no girl, if with her teeth she cannot crack an
      almond. Lilia, you're not a bit of assistance; you've tied up the end of
      the nut-bag in a hard knot, upset the apple-dish, put the tablecloth on
      crooked, and&mdash;oh, dear&mdash;now you've stepped in the pop-corn,&rdquo; as
      Lilia, trying desperately to cross the room without knocking something
      over, as usual, had hit the corn-pan in her airy flight. &ldquo;You have such a
      genius for stepping into half-a-dozen things at once, I think you must be
      web-footed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's possible,&rdquo; retorted the unfortunate Lilia; &ldquo;I've often been
      told I was a duck of a girl, and this proves it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you realize, girls,&rdquo; said Edith, after a while, &ldquo;that we shall all be
      visited by ghosts and visions to-night, if we don't terminate this repast?
      I'll put away the dishes, Bell, if you'll move the sofas up to the fire,
      so that we can have our good-night chat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, speedily, six warm dressing-sacques were slipped on, and then, the
      lamps being turned out, in the ruddy glow of the firelight, the brown, the
      yellow, and the dark hair was taken down, and the housekeepers, braiding
      it up for the night, talked and dreamed and built their castles in the
      air, as all young things are wont to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Girls, dear old girls,&rdquo; said Alice, softly, breaking an unusual silence
      of two minutes; &ldquo;isn't this cosy and sweet and friendly beyond anything?
      How thankful we ought to be for the happy lives God gives us! We have been
      put into this beautiful world and taken care of so wisely and kindly every
      day; yet we don't often speak, or even think, about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is trouble, sometimes, more than happiness, that leads us into
      thinking about God's care and goodness,&rdquo; said Edith, &ldquo;although it's very
      strange that it should. Before my mother's death I was just a little baby
      playing with letter-blocks, and all at once, after that, I began to make
      the letters into words and spell out things for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a perfect heathen I am,&rdquo; burst out Jo. &ldquo;I can't feel any of these
      things any more than if I were a Chinaman. Or, perhaps, it is as Edith
      says, I am still playing with blocks, although I cannot even see the
      letters on them. I wonder if I shall ever be wide awake enough for that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out of the window, Jo,&rdquo; said
    </p>
    <p>
      Bell, who was leaning on the sill. &ldquo;Don't you think if God can make out of
      all that snow and ice, in three short months, a lovely, tender, green,
      springing world, He can make something out of us! Isn't it a wonderful
      thing that He can wake up the life that's asleep under the frozen earth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; rejoined Jo, dismally, &ldquo;there's something to begin on out there,
      but I don't think I have much of a soul; any way, I have never seen any
      signs of it. You always say things so prettily, Bell, that I like to hear
      you sermonize. You'd make a good minister's wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you have plenty of 'soul material,' Jo,&rdquo; said Lilia, confusedly
      struggling to make a figure of speech express her meaning. &ldquo;There's lots
      of it there, only it wants to be blown up, somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks for your encouragement,&rdquo; said Jo, amid the laughter that followed
      Lilia's peculiar metaphor. &ldquo;I think if you'll try to handle the spiritual
      bellows, you'll find it's harder work than you imagine. Now don't laugh,
      girls, because I really do feel solemn about it, only I talk in my usual
      frivolous way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You always make yourself appear wicked, Jo,&rdquo; said her loving champion,
      Patty, &ldquo;but I happen to know a few facts on the opposite side. Who was it
      who gave every cent of her month's allowance to Mrs. Hart, the poor
      washerwoman who scorched her white skirt; and who stayed away from the
      church sociable to take care of that horrid room mate of hers who had a
      headache?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Patty, if you don't desist,&rdquo; cried Jo, with a flaming face, and
      brandishing a hair-brush fiercely, &ldquo;I'll throw this at your dear,
      charitable little head. Now, Bell, you know we all agreed to tell a story
      of adventure each night before going to bed, and I think you, as hostess,
      ought to begin. If the entertainment is delayed much longer it will find
      me asleep with fatigue and over-feeding in the front row of the
      orchestra.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, I can't begin!&rdquo; cried Bell, &ldquo;Nothing ever happened to me except
      going to California and having a double wedding in the family. That's the
      sum total of my adventures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make up something then, or tell us a true story about California. Oh, you
      do have such a good time, and funny things are always happening to you,&rdquo;
       sighed Lilia. &ldquo;You never seem to have any trials.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trials!&rdquo; rejoined Bell, sarcastically. &ldquo;I should think I hadn't. Perhaps
      I haven't a little scamp of a brother and an awfully fussy old aunty!
      Perhaps I'm not such an idiot that I can't multiply eight and nine, or
      seven and six, without a lead-pencil; perhaps I wasn't left at school
      while my parents toured in the South! Don't you call those afflictions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; answered Lilia, joining in the general laugh; &ldquo;and I'll never
      allude to your good fortune again. Now tell us a California story,&mdash;that's
      a dear,&mdash;for I'm getting sleepy as well as Jo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said Bell, walking about the room absent-mindedly, until her
      eyes rested on the cabinet, &ldquo;I'll tell you the story of these;&rdquo; and she
      took up a string of dusty pearls which were seamed and cracked as if by
      fire. &ldquo;Now open your eyes and lend me your ears, for I shall make it as
      'bookish' and romantic as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last summer Mother and I were living in a beautiful valley a hundred
      miles from San Francisco. It was near the mining districts, where Father
      was attending to some business. Of course, a great many Mexicans and
      Indians, as well as Chinamen, worked in these mines, and we used to see
      them very often. Mother and I were sitting under the peach-trees in the
      garden one afternoon. It was so beautiful sewing or reading in that
      California garden, for the fruit was ripe and hanging in bushels on the
      trees, as lovely to look at as it was luscious to eat; some of the peaches
      were a rich yellow inside and others snow-white, except where the crimson
      stones had tinged their sockets with rosy little spots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't,&rdquo; cried Jo; &ldquo;you'll make us discontented with our New England
      apples!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were chatting and eating peaches,&rdquo; continued Bell, &ldquo;when the gate
      opened, and an Indian girl with an old squaw came in and approached us,
      The girl could speak English, and told me her name was Eskaluna. I had
      heard about her, and knew that she was the beauty and belle of the tribe,
      and was going to marry the chief's son when the next moon came; for our
      Indian cook was as gossipy as a Yankee, and was forever telling us tales.
      She was the most beautiful creature I ever saw: lovely black hair, not so
      coarse as is usual with them, brilliant dark eyes, good features, and the
      prettiest slim hands and graceful arms. She was dressed gaily and
      handsomely in the fashion of her tribe, and on her lovely, bare, brown
      neck was this long string of Mexican pearls, which we noticed at once as
      being very valuable. She stayed there all the afternoon under the
      fruit-trees, and really grew quite confidential. Mother, meanwhile, had
      gone into ecstacies over her beautiful pearls, and had taken them from her
      neck to examine them. At sunset, when she went home to her wigwam, she
      slipped the necklace into mother's lap, saying, with her sweet trick of
      speech, 'I eatie your peachie, you takie my beads.' Of course, mother
      could not accept them, and Eskaluna departed in quite a disappointed mood.
      I remember being sorry that the pretty young thing was going to marry the
      disagreeable, ugly chief. He was just as jealous and ferocious as he could
      be&mdash;wouldn't let her talk to one of the warriors of the tribe, and
      had shot one man already because he fancied Eskaluna admired him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A chorus of &ldquo;Oh's&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ah's&rdquo; interrupted Bell, and Alice's eyes grew
      round with interest, for she was sixteen and had been called a &ldquo;cruel
      coquette&rdquo; by a young student at Wareham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a few days our Indian cook came home at night from the mines, saying
      that he wanted a holiday the next morning to go to a funeral. We had heard
      that in some tribes they burn the bodies of the dead, and wondered whether
      his were one of them, so we asked him the particulars, of course, and were
      terribly shocked when we heard that it was the funeral of poor Eskaluna,
      who had visited us so lately, in all her dusky beauty. Nakawa told us the
      whole story in his broken English, and a sad one it was. Her lover, the
      chief, as I have said, was always jealous of her, and on the afternoon she
      came to our house, he had heard from some crafty villain or other (an
      enemy of Eskaluna's, of course), that she was false, and, instead of
      intending to marry him, loved a handsome young Indian of another tribe,
      and was planning to run away with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This fired his hot blood, and he rushed off on the village road
      determined to kill her. He climbed a large sycamore tree on a lonely part
      of the way, and there waited until the shadows fell over the mountain
      sides, and the sun, dropping behind their peaks, left the San Jacinto
      valley in fast-growing darkness. At last he saw the gleam of her scarlet
      dress in the distance, and soon he heard her voice as she came singing
      along, little thinking of her dreadful fate. He took sure aim at the heart
      that was beating happily and carelessly under its cape of birds' feathers;
      shot, and so swift and unerring was his arrow that she fell in an instant,
      dead, upon the path. Then, leaving her with the helpless old squaw, he
      escaped into a canon near by.

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next day we went over to the Indian encampment, and reached the place
      just after poor Eskaluna had been burned on the funeral pile. We went
      close to the spot and could hardly help crying when we thought of her
      beauty and sweetness, and her sad and undeserved death. Up near the head
      of the pile where that lovely brown neck of hers had rested,&mdash;the
      prettiest neck in the world,&mdash;lay this charred string of pearls she
      had worn in our garden. Mother asked for it as a remembrance, and the old
      squaw gave it to her. Eskaluna's brother is on the war-path after her
      murderer, I believe, to this day, if he hasn't killed him yet; for he was
      determined to avenge her. Now, isn't that romantic, and tragic at the same
      time, girls? Poor Eskaluna! I don't know that her fate would have been
      much easier if she had married the chief; but it is hard to think of her
      being so heartlessly murdered when she was so innocent and true; and
      that's the end of my story. Who comes next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I, at this hour,&rdquo; yawned Jo, &ldquo;but it was a good tale!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I, after that thrilling experience of yours!&rdquo; said Alice, admiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can think of no story half so delightful as the dreams we shall have if
      we go to bed,&rdquo; murmured Edith from her cozy corner. &ldquo;Come, it is after
      ten, and the wide bed calls loudly for occupants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a half-hour all six were asleep, and the bright-faced moon, looking in
      at the piazza window, smiled as she saw the half-dozen heads in a row, and
      the bed surrounded by croquet mallets and balls.

      CHAPTER III&mdash;AN EMERGENCY CASE

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE next morning
      broke clear, bright, and sparkling, but bitterly cold. I cannot attempt to
      tell you all the doings of that indefatigable and ingenious bevy of girls
      during the day. Miss Miranda, their opposite neighbor, had kept to her
      post of observation, the window, very closely, and had seen much to awaken
      scorn and surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa'al, Jane!&rdquo; said she, excitedly, in the afternoon, &ldquo;there they go
      ag'in! That's the fourth time the hoss has been harnessed into Allen's
      pung to-day; and now they've got their uncle. Whatever they find to laugh
      so over, and where they go to, is more'n I can see. They haven't done up
      their dinner dishes, I know, for I've been watching of 'em and they
      hain't had time to do 'em so quick as this, though Bell Winship is
      as spry as a skeeter when she gets a-goin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Miranda's organs of vision were better than magnifying glasses, for,
      aided by a lively imagination, they could dart around corners and through
      doors with great ease. Bell avowed confidentially to Patty that morning,
      when she met her neighbor's eyes fixed on the pantry window, that she
      believed Miss Miranda could see a fly-speck on top of a liberty-pole.
    </p>

      The girls had made the day a very long and lively one, and in the evening,
      their spirits still high and their inventive powers still unimpaired, they
      gave an impromptu concert. The audience was small but appreciative.
      Grandmother was in a private box&mdash;the high-backed arm-chair in the
      cosiest corner; Uncle Harry sat on a hastily-erected throne made by
      perching a stool on the dining-table, and being given a large pair of
      goggles, was requested to serve as dramatic and musical critic for the
      morning newspapers. Two or three of the boarders from Mrs. Carter's famous
      Winter Farmhouse on the hill, the young schoolmaster (a Bowdoin student
      earning his college course by odd terms of teaching), and Hugh Pennell,
      his chum and classmate, home on a brief holiday, made quite a brave show
      when seated in three rows, while the unaffected laughter, the open mouths,
      and the staring eyes of &ldquo;the help,&rdquo; Emma Jane Perkins, Betty Bean, and 'Bijah
      Flagg, who were grouped at the hall door, helped in the general merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bell had a keen sense of the ridiculous and a voice like a meadow-lark. Jo
      was capital, too, as a mimic, so together, they gave some absurdly funny
      scenes from famous operas. Bell had thrown on an evening dress of her
      cousin's, which happened to be left in the house, and this, with its short
      sleeves, showing her round, girlish arms, and its long train, made her
      such a distracting little prima donna of fifteen, that Hugh Pennell quite
      laid his boyish heart at her feet. She sang &ldquo;The Last Rose of Summer&rdquo; with
      all the smiles, head-tossings, arch looks, casting down of eyelids, and
      kissing of finger-tips at the close, which generally accompany it when
      sung by the stage soprano, and she was naturally greeted with rapturous
      applause. Then Jo, as the tenor, in dressing-gown and smoking-cap for male
      attire, sang a fervent duet with Alice Forsaith, rendering it with
      original Italian words and embraces at the end of every measure.

      Tableaux showing scenes from well-known novels, and thrilling historical
      events depicted in pantomime, came next, and the company was invited to
      name them as they followed one another in quick succession,&mdash;Eliza
      crossing the river by leaping from ice block to ice block, the bloodhounds
      in hot pursuit; Pochahontas saving the life of her noble Captain John;
      Rochester, holding Jane Eyre spellbound by the steely glitter of his eye;
      and the Pilgrim Fathers and Mothers, landing on a stern and rock-bound
      coast, ably represented by the dining-room table. As Uncle Harry sat on
      the table he was obliged to be the center of this thrilling scene, which
      was variously surmised by the audience to be the capture of a slave-ship
      by pirates, the rescue of a babe from a tenement-house fire, the killing
      of Julius Cæsar in the Roman Senate, or an impassioned attempt to drag
      Casabianca from the burning deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      After bidding their visitors goodnight, Bell and Jo went into the kitchen
      to put buckwheat cakes to raise for breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I'll chop the meat hash for a half-hour while the kitchen is
      warm,&rdquo; said Jo. &ldquo;Emma Jane is right about the knife; it is dull beyond
      words!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is any duller than Emma Jane herself, I am sorry for it,&rdquo; rejoined
      Bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a poor workman who complains of his tools, Jo,&rdquo; said Patty, looking
      in at the door, with a superior air; &ldquo;Columbus discovered America in an
      open boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would never have discovered America with this chopping-knife,&rdquo; quoth
      Jo, bringing it down with vicious emphasis on the unoffending meat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you notice Emma Jane's expression as she stood in the doorway to
      night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; replied Bell, as she bustled about her last tasks at closet,
      cupboard, and sink. &ldquo;Not a penny of my money shall go to the heathen in
      other lands until I have done some missionary work with her. In ten days I
      propose to make her stand straight, hold her head up, keep her mouth
      closed when not occupied in conversation or eating, stop straining her
      hair out by the roots, tie the ends of her braids with ribbon instead of
      twine, give up her magenta hood, and a few other little details.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see how you dare advise her at her advanced age,&rdquo; responded Jo.
      &ldquo;I suppose she is thirteen, but she appears about thirty. Look, Bell, can
      this hash be safely trusted now to the pearly teeth of our parlor
      boarders, or are the pieces too large for their 'delicate sensibilities'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that it may escape criticism,&rdquo; laughed Bell. &ldquo;Cover it with a
      clean towel and a platter, and one of us will give it a last castigation
      before it goes in the frying-pan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never had such a good time in my life, never, never!&rdquo; sighed Lilia, as
      she blew out the lamp, and tucked herself on the front side of the bed, a
      little later. &ldquo;I have only two things to trouble me. First: my wisdom
      tooth feels as if it were going to ache again. Second: it is my turn to
      build the kitchen fire in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Console yourself with one thought, my dear,&rdquo; murmured Bell, drowsily, yet
      sagely. &ldquo;Both these misfortunes can't happen to you, for if your tooth
      chances to ache, we shall not have the heart to make you build the fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't tell her that,&rdquo; urged Jo, with a prodigious yawn, &ldquo;or she will be
      feigning toothache constantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lilia's fears had good foundation, however, for in the middle of the
      night, Jo, who slept next the front side, wakened suddenly to find her
      slipping quietly out of bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter, Lilia!&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing; don't wake the others, but that miserable tooth grumbles just
      enough to keep me awake, and my temple aches and my cheek, too. Where is
      the lotion I use for bathing my face, do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, where you put it this morning, on the back of the wash-stand;
      sha'n't I light the lamp and help you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, hush!&rdquo; said Lilia. &ldquo;I can put my hand on it in the dark. Here it
      is! I'll bathe my face a few minutes, and then try to go to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, she anointed herself freely, put the bottle and sponge under the head
      of the bed lest she should need them again, and, finally, the pain growing
      less, fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning, Bell, who wakened first, rubbed her eyes drowsily, glanced
      at Lilia, who was breathing quietly, and uttered a piercing shriek. This
      in turn aroused the other girls, who joined in the shriek on general
      principles, and then, blinking in the half-light, looked where Bell
      pointed. One side of Lilia's face was swollen, and of a dark, purple
      color, presenting a truly frightful appearance. At length, hearing the
      confusion, Lilia awoke with a start, and her eyes being open, and rolling
      about in surprise, she looked still more alarming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth is the matter, girls?&rdquo; she asked, sitting up in bed,
      smoothing back her hair and rubbing her heavy lids.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon Edith and Alice began to tremble and nobody answered her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;K-k-keep c-c-calm,&rdquo; said Bell. &ldquo;Lilia, dear, your face is badly swollen
      and inflamed, and we're afraid you are going to be ill, but we'll send for
      the doctor straight away. Does it pain you very much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lilia jumped up hastily, and, looking in the mirror, uttered a cry of
      terror, and sank back into the rocking-chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear! Oh, dear! What can it be! Oh, take me home to my father! It
      must be a malignant pustule&mdash;or spotted fever&mdash;or something
      dreadful! What shall I do? Bell, you are a doctor's daughter; do find out
      what's the matter with me! I am disfigured for life, and I wasn't very
      good-looking before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; said Bell, &ldquo;let us dress this very instant, for we can't be too
      quick about a thing of this kind. You, Jo, build the kitchen fire, and,
      Alice, make a blaze on the hearth in here; then, after we've made her
      comfortable, Edith can run and tell Uncle Harry to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put on the kettle,&rdquo; added Patty, &ldquo;and heat blankets; they always do that
      in emergencies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't frighten me to death,&rdquo; wailed Lilia, &ldquo;calling me 'a thing of this
      kind' and an 'emergency.' I don't feel a hit worse than I did in the
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had neuralgia in her face,&rdquo; explained Jo; &ldquo;that must have had
      something to do with it. She put on some of her liniment, and then dropped
      off to sleep. Come, darling, let us tuck you in bed again; try to keep up
      your courage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then there was a hasty consultation in the kitchen 'midst many
      groans and tears. Bell was an authority on sickness, and she said, with an
      awestruck face, that it must be a dreadful attack of erysipelas in the
      very last stages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; cried Alice, perplexed, &ldquo;it is all very strange, for why does she
      have so little pain, and how could her face have turned so black from
      mortification in one night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blood-poisoning is very quick and very deadly,&rdquo; said Patty, who had heard
      about such a case in her own family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness knows what it is,&rdquo; exclaimed Bell, wringing her hands in nervous
      terror. &ldquo;What to do with her I don't know; whether to put bricks to her
      head and ice to her feet, or keep her head cold and heat her
      'extremities,' as father calls them&mdash;whether to give her a sweat or
      keep her dry, or wrap her in blankets, or get the linen sheets. Jo is with
      her now. If you'll go and wake Uncle Harry, Edith, it is the best thing we
      can do. Run along with her, too, Patty, and you won't be afraid together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alice and Bell went back presently to Lilia, who looked even worse, now
      that the room was bright with the glow of the open fire and the pale light
      of the student lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You patient old darling!&rdquo; cried Bell, falling on her knees beside the
      bed. &ldquo;We have sent for Uncle Harry and the Doctor, and now you are sure to
      be all right, for we've taken the thing in good time. Good gracious!! what
      bottle have I tipped over under this bed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's my neuralgia liniment,&rdquo; murmured Lilia, faintly. &ldquo;I bathed my face
      in it last night, and put it under there afterward. Don't spill it, for I
      can't get any more here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your neuralgia lotion!&rdquo; shrieked Bell, first with a look of blank
      astonishment, and then one of excitement and glee mixed in equal parts.
      &ldquo;Look at it, girls! Look, Alice and Jo! Oh, Lilia, you precious,
      blundering goose!&rdquo; and thereupon she dragged out from beneath the bed
      valance a pint bottle of violet ink, and then relapsed into a paroxysm of
      voiceless mirth. Just then the hack door opened, and in hurried Uncle
      Harry, Edith, and Patty, much terrified, for they had heard the shouts and
      gasps and excited voices from outside, and supposed that Lilia must at
      least have fallen into convulsions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see the poor child immediately,&rdquo; cried Mr. Winship. &ldquo;What is the
      trouble with you, Bell? are you demented? and where is Lilia?&rdquo; looking at
      the apparently empty bed, for Lilia had wound herself in the sheets and
      blankets, disappeared from view, and was endeavoring to force a pillow
      into her mouth in order to render her shame-faced laughter inaudible. &ldquo;Are
      you trying to play a joke on me?&rdquo; continued he, with as much dignity as
      was consistent with an attire made up of an undershirt, a pair of
      trousers, overshoes, a tall hat, and a gold-headed cane which he had quite
      unconsciously caught up in his hasty flight from his chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; answered Bell, between her gasps, and trying desperately
      hard to regain her sobriety,&mdash;&ldquo;the fact is&mdash;Uncle Harry&mdash;we
      made&mdash;a mistake, and so did&mdash;Lilia. There were two bottles just
      alike on the wash-stand, and in the night she bathed her face for five
      minutes in the purple ink! Oh, oh, oh!!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Harry's face relaxed into a broad smile as he realized the joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Winship, you should have seen her!&rdquo; sighed Jo, lifting her head
      from the sofa-pillow, with streaming eyes. &ldquo;All her face, except part of
      her forehead and one cheek, was covered with enormous dark purple
      blotches. She looked like a clown, or a Fourth of July fantastic, or
      anything else frightful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Edith, slyly, &ldquo;Bell said mortification had taken place. I
      don't think Lilia has ever been more mortified than she is now; do you?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Puns are out of place, Edith,&rdquo; said Bell, severely. &ldquo;Don't hurry, Uncle
      Harry. Don't let any thought of your rather peculiar attire cause you
      embarrassment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But before Bell's teasing voice had ceased, the last thud, thud of his
      rubbers, and click, click of his gold-headed cane were heard in the hall,
      and he thought, as he tried to finish his early morning nap, that it would
      be a long time before he allowed those madcap girls to rout him out of bed
      again at five o'clock on a winter's day.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the girls themselves, they did not even make a trial of slumber,
      but first scrubbed Lilia energetically with hard soap and pumice, and then
      made molasses candy, determined that the roaring kitchen fire should be
      used to some purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having gained so much time by the unusual way in which they had started
      the day, they were enabled to look back at nightfall on an unprecedented
      number of activities, some of them rather unique and original. There was a
      call upon Emma Jane's mother, another upon Mrs. Carter at the Winter Farm,
      a sleigh-ride with Geoffrey Strong, the vehicle being a truck for hauling
      wood, an hour's coasting down Brigadier hill, and a trip to the doctor's
      for courtplaster and arnica and peppermint and cough lozenges. Then
      directly after luncheon Bell and Jo made a private and confidential call
      upon Grandma Win-ship's pig, leaving with him as evidences of regard
      several samples of their own cookery. This call they hoped was unnoticed,
      but an hour afterwards the other four girls were espied coming from the
      Winships', all clad in black garments of one sort or another. When
      questioned as to the meaning of this mysterious piece of foolishness they
      merely remarked that they, too, had called upon the Winships pig, but that
      it was a visit of condolence and sympathy.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV&mdash;A WINTER PICNIC
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>OU may think that
      Lilia's &ldquo;mortification&rdquo; was quite an excitement in this enterprising young
      household; yet I assure you that never twenty-four hours passed but a
      ridiculous adventure of some kind overtook the girls. The daily bulletin
      which they carried over to Mrs. Carter at the Winter Farm kept the worthy
      inmates in constant wonderment as to what would happen next. Sometimes
      there was a regular programme for the next day, prepared the night before,
      but oftener, things happened of themselves, and when they do that, you
      know, pleasure seems a deal more satisfying and delightful, because it is
      unexpected. Uncle Harry was in great demand, and very often made one of
      the gay party of young folks off for a frolic. They defied King Winter
      openly, and went on all sorts of excursions, even on a bona-fide picnic,
      notwithstanding the two feet of snow on the ground. The way of it was
      this: On Friday, the boys&mdash;Hugh Pennell, Bell's cousin, Jack Brayton,
      and the young schoolmaster&mdash;turned the great bare hall in the top of
      the old Winship family house into a woodland bower.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the way, I have not told you much about Geoffrey Strong yet, because
      the girls of the story have had everything their own way, but Geoffrey
      Strong was well worth knowing. He was only eighteen years old, but had
      finished his sophomore year at Bowdoin College, and was teaching the
      district school that he might partly earn the money necessary to take him
      through the remainder of the course. He was as sturdy and strong as his
      name, or as one of the stout pine-trees of his native State, as gentle and
      chivalrous as a boy knight of the olden time; as true and manly a lad, and
      withal as good and earnest a teacher, notwithstanding his youth, as any
      little country urchin could wish. Mr. Win-ship was his guardian, and thus
      he had become quite one of the Winship family.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys were making the picnic grounds when I interrupted my story with
      this long parenthesis. They took a large pair of old drop curtains used at
      some time or other in church tableaux, and made a dark green carpet by
      stretching them across the floor smoothly and tacking them down; they
      wreathed the pillars and trimmed the doors and windows with evergreens,
      and then planted young spruce and cedar and hemlock trees in the corners
      or scattered them about the room firmly rooted in painted nail-kegs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks rather jolly, boys, doesn't it?&rdquo; cried Jack, rubbing his cold
      fingers, &ldquo;but I'm afraid we've gone as far as we can; we can't make birds
      and flowers and brooks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the special difficulty?&rdquo; asked Geoffrey. &ldquo;We'll borrow Grandmother
      Winship's two cages of canaries and Mrs. Adams' two; then we'll bring over
      Mrs. Carter's pet parrot, and altogether we'll be musical enough,
      considering the fact that the thermometer is below zero.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This suggestion of Geoff's they accordingly adopted, and their mimic
      forest became tuneful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next stroke of genius came from Hugh Pennell. He found bunches of
      white and yellow everlastings at home with which he mixed some cleverly
      constructed bright tissue-paper flowers, of mysterious botanical
      structure. He planted these in pots, and tied them to shrubs, and behold,
      their forest bloomed!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we have finished now, boys,&rdquo; said Hugh, dejectedly, as he put his
      last bed of whiteweed and buttercups under a shady tree. (They were made
      of paper, and were growing artistically in a moss-covered chopping-tray.)
      &ldquo;We can't get up a brook, and a brook is a handy thing at a picnic, too.
      Good for the small children to fall into, good for drinking, good for
      dish-washing, good for its cool and musical tinkle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have an idea,&rdquo; suggested Jack, who was mounted on a step-ladder busily
      engaged in tying a stuffed owl and a blue jay to a tree-top. &ldquo;I have an
      idea. We can fill the ice-water tank, put it on a shelf, let the water run
      into a tub, then station a boy in the corner to keep filling the tank from
      the tub. There's your stagnant pool and your running streamlet. There's
      your drinking-water, your dish-washer, your musical tinkle, and possibly
      your small child's watery grave. What could be more romantic?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out with him!&rdquo; shouted Geoff. &ldquo;He ought to be drowned for proposing such
      an apology for a brook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fail to see the point,&rdquo; said Jack; &ldquo;the sound would be sylvan and
      suggestive, and I've no doubt the girls would be charmed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll brook no further argument on the subject,&rdquo; retorted Hugh; &ldquo;the
      afternoon is running away with us. We might bring up the bath-tub, or the
      watering-trough, sink it in an evergreen bank and surround it with house
      plants, but I don't think it would satisfy us exactly. I'll tell you, let
      us give up the brook and build a sort of what-do-you-call'em for a
      retreat, in one corner.&rdquo; After some explanations from Hugh about his plan,
      the boys finally succeeded in manufacturing something romantic and
      ingenious. Two blooming oleanders in boxes were brought from Uncle Harry's
      parlor, there was a hemlock tree with a rustic seat under it, there was an
      evergreen arch above, there was a little rockery built with a dozen stones
      from the old wall behind the barn, and there were Miss Jane Sawyer's
      potted scarlet geraniums set in among them, all surmounted by two banging
      baskets and a bird-cage. With nothing save an airtight stove to warm it
      into life (the ugliness of the stove quite hidden by screens of green
      boughs), the cold, bare hall was magically changed into a green forest,
      vocal with singing birds and radiant with blooming flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys swung their hats in irrepressible glee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't this be a surprise to the people, though! Won't they think of the
      desert blooming as the rose!&rdquo; cried Hugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy it won't astonish Uncle Harry and Grandmother much,&rdquo; answered
      Jack, dryly, &ldquo;inasmuch as we've nearly borrowed them out of house and home
      during the operation. Old Mrs. Winship said when I took her hammer,
      hatchet, chopping-tray, house plants, and screw-driver, that perhaps she
      had better go over to Mrs. Carter's and board. The girls will be fairly
      stunned, though. Just imagine Bell's eyes! I told them we'd see to
      sweeping and heating the hall, but they don't expect any decorations.
      Well, I'm off. Lock the door, Geoff, and guard it like a dragon; we meet
      at eleven to-morrow morning, do we? Be on hand, sharp, and let us all go
      in and view the scene together. I wouldn't for worlds miss hearing and
      seeing the girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack and Hugh started for home, and Geoff went downstairs to run a
      gauntlet of questioning from Jo Fenton, who was present in Grandmother
      Winship's kitchen on one of the borrowing tours of the day, and extremely
      anxious to find out why so much mysterious hammering was going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these preparations were in progress, the six juvenile housekeepers
      were undergoing abject suffering in their cookery for the picnic. It had
      been a day of disasters from beginning to end&mdash;the first really
      mournful one in their experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      It commenced bright and early, too; in fact, was all ready for them before
      they awoke in the morning, and the coal fire began it, for it went out in
      the night. Everybody knows what it is to build a fire in a large coal
      stove; it was Jo's turn as stoker and tirewoman, and I regret to say that
      this circumstance made her a little cross, in fact, audibly so.
    </p>
    <p>
      After much searching for kindling-wood, however, much chattering of teeth,
      for the thermometer was below zero, much vicious banging of stove doors,
      and clattering of hods and shovels, that trouble was overcome. But, dear
      me! it was only the first drop of a pouring rain of accidents, and at last
      the girls accepted it as a fatal shower which must fall before the weather
      would clear, and thus resigned themselves to the inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The breakfast was as bad as a breakfast knew how to be. The girls were all
      cooks to-day in the exciting preparation for the picnic, for they wanted
      to take especially tempting dainties in order that they might astonish
      more experienced providers. Patty scorched the milk toast; Edith, that
      most precise and careful of all little women under the sun, broke a
      platter and burned her fingers; Lilia browned a delicious omelet, and
      waved the spider triumphantly in the air, astonished at her own success,
      when, alas, the smooth little circlet slipped illnaturedly into the coal
      hod. Lilia stood still in horror and dismay, while Bell fished it hastily
      out, looking very crumpled, sooty, shrunken, and generally penitent, if an
      omelet can assume that expression. She slapped it on the table severely,
      and said, with a little choke and tear in her voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last of the eggs went into that omelet, and it is going to he rinsed,
      and fried over, and eaten. There isn't another thing in the house for
      breakfast. There is no bread; Alice put cream-of-tartar into the
      buckwheats, instead of saleratus, and measured it with a tablespoon
      besides; Miss Miranda's cat upset the milk can; the potatoes are frozen;
      and I am ashamed to borrow anything more of Grandmother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; cried Alice, with much determination. &ldquo;Sooner eat omelet and coal
      hod, too! Never mind the breakfast! there are always apples. What shall we
      take to the picnic? We can suggest luncheon at high noon, and no one will
      suspect we haven't breakfasted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's make mince pies,&rdquo; cried Jo, animatedly, from her seat on the
      wood-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goose,&rdquo; answered Bell, with a sarcastic smile. &ldquo;There's plenty of time to
      make mince-meat, of course!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, we must have jelly-cake,&rdquo; said Lilia, with decision, while
      dishing up the injured omelet for the second time. &ldquo;We had better carry
      the delicacies, for Mrs. Pennell and the boys will be sure to bring bread
      and meat and common things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, tarts, tarts!&rdquo; exclaimed Edith, in an ecstacy of reminiscence. &ldquo;I
      haven't had tarts for a perfect age! Do you think we could manage them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must be easy enough,&rdquo; answered Patty, with calm authority. &ldquo;Cut a
      hole out of the middle of each round thing, then till it up with jelly and
      bake it; that's simple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0006" id="linkimage-0006"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

      <a href="images/0093.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad you think so,&rdquo; responded Edith, with an air of deep melancholy and
      cynicism, as she prepared to wash the cooking dishes and found an empty
      dish-water pot. &ldquo;I should think the jelly would grow hard and crusty
      before the tarts baked, but I suppose it's all right. Everything we touch
      to-day is sure to fail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how much better if you said, 'I'll try, I'll try, I'll try,'&rdquo; sang
      Bell, in a spasm of gayety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how much sadder you will feel when you've tried, by and by,&rdquo; retorted
      Edith. &ldquo;Is there anything difficult about pastry, I wonder? Look in the
      cookbook. Does it have to be soaked over night like ham, or hung for two
      weeks like game, or put away in a stone jar like fruit-cake, or 'braised'
      or 'trussed' or 'larded' or anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Patty, looking up from the 'Bride's Manual,' &ldquo;but it has to be
      pounded on a marble slab with a glass rolling-pin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stuff and nonsense,&rdquo; said Bell, &ldquo;Tarts are nothing but pie-crust. This
      village is situated in the very middle of what is called the New England
      Pie Belt, and the glass rolling-pin and the marble slab have never been
      seen by the oldest or youngest inhabitant. I know that bride. When she
      makes pastry you can see her diamond engagement ring flash as she dips her
      turquoise scoop into her ruby flour-barrel. Look up soft gingerbread,
      Patty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four cups best New Orleans molasses&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The molasses is out,&rdquo; said Jo; &ldquo;find jelly-cake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jelly all gone,&rdquo; said Bell; &ldquo;where, I can't think, for there were
      seventeen tumblers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boys are awfully fond of it with bread,&rdquo; said Alice, reminiscently.
      &ldquo;How about doughnuts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Bell answered, &ldquo;of course you'll go to the store for more
      eggs and a pail of lard. We're out of molasses, eggs, lard, ginger, jelly,
      patience, and luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Over an hour was spent in futile excursions through the cookery books,
      vain rummagings of the pantry and larder, frequent trips to the country
      store, and nothing was a triumphant success. Things that should have been
      thin were fat and puffy; those that should have risen high and light as
      air were flat and soggy; pots, pans, bowls, were heaped on one another in
      the sink until at one o'clock Alice Forsaith went to bed with a headache,
      leaving the kitchen in a state of general confusion and uproar. I cannot
      bear to tell you all the sorry incidents of that dreadful day, but Bell
      had shared in the blunders with the rest. She had gone to the store-room
      for citron, and had stumbled on a jar of frozen &ldquo;something&rdquo; very like
      mince-meat. This, indeed, was a precious discovery! She flew back to the
      kitchen, crying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah! We'll have the pies after all, girls! Mother has left a pot of
      mince-meat in the pantry. It's frozen, but it will be all right. You trust
      to me. I've made pies before, and these shall not be a failure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The spider was heated, and enough meat for three pies put in to thaw. It
      thawed, naturally, the fire being extremely hot, and it presently became
      very thin and curious in its appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks like thick soup with pieces of chopped apple in it,&rdquo; said Lilia
      to Bell, who was patting down a very tough, substantial bottom crust on a
      pie plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We-l-l, it does!&rdquo; owned the head cook, frankly; &ldquo;but I suppose it will
      boil down or thicken up in baking. I don't like to taste it, somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very natural,&rdquo; said Lilia, dryly. &ldquo;It doesn't look 'tasty;' and, to tell
      the truth, it does not look at all as I've been brought up to imagine
      mince-meat ought to look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't be responsible for your 'bringing up,' Lill. Please pour it in,
      and I'll hold the plate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mixture trickled in; Bell put a very lumpy, spotted covering of dough
      over it, slashed a bold original design in the middle for a ventilator,
      and deposited the first pie in the oven with a sigh of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at this happy moment, Betty Bean, Mrs. Winship's maid-of-all-work,
      walked in with a can of kerosene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think that's funny looking mince-meat, Betty?&rdquo; asked Patty,
      pointing to the frying-pan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty the wise looked at it one moment, and then said, with youthful
      certainty and disdain: &ldquo;'Tain't no more mince-meat than a cat's
      foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was decisive, and the utterance fell like a thunder-bolt upon the
      kitchen-maids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious,&rdquo; cried Bell, dropping her good English and her rolling-pin at
      the same time. &ldquo;What do you mean? It looked exactly like it before it
      melted. What is it, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suet,&rdquo; answered cruel Betty Bean. &ldquo;Your ma chopped it and done it up in
      molasses for her suet plum puddins this winter. It's thick when it's cold;
      and when it was froze, maybe it did look like pie-meat with a good deal of
      apple in it; but it ain't no such thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was too much. If I am to relate truly the adventures of this
      half-dozen suffering little maidens, I must tell you that Bell entirely
      lost her sunny temper for a moment; caught up the unoffending spider
      filled with molasses and floating bits of suet; carried it steadily and
      swiftly to the back-door, hurled it into a snow-bank; slammed the door,
      and sat down on a flour-firkin, burying her face in the very dingy
      roller-towel. The girls stopped laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, Bluebell,&rdquo; cooed Patty, sympathetically, smoothing her
      hostess's curly hair with a very doughnutty hand, and trying to wipe her
      flushed cheeks with an apron redolent of hot fat. &ldquo;You can use the rest of
      the pie-crust for tarts, and my doughnuts are swelling up
      be-yoo-ti-ful-ly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bell withdrew the towel from her merry, tearful eyes, and said with savage
      emphasis:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If any of you dare tell this at the picnic to-morrow, or let Uncle Harry
      or the boys know about it, I'll&mdash;I don't know what I'll do,&rdquo; finished
      she, weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a fearful threat,&rdquo; laughed Jo,&mdash;&ldquo;'The King of France and
      fifty thousand men plucked forth their swords! and put them up again.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so this cloud passed over, and another and yet another with comforting
      gleams of sunshine between, till at length it was seven o'clock in the
      evening before the dishes were washed and the kitchen tidied; then six as
      tired young housewives stretched themselves before the parlor fire as a
      bright blaze often shines upon. Bell, pale and pretty, was curled upon the
      sofa, with her eyes closed. The other girls were lounging in different
      attitudes of dejection, all with from one to three burned fingers
      enveloped in cloths. The results of the day's labor were painfully meager,&mdash;a
      colander full of doughnuts, some currant buns, molasses ginger-bread, and
      a loaf of tolerably light fruit cake. Out in the kitchen closet lay a
      melancholy pile of failure,&mdash;Alice's pop-overs, which had refused to
      pop; Patty's tarts, rocky and tough; and a bride's cake that would have
      made any newly married couple feel as if they were at the funeral of their
      own stomachs. The girls had flown too high in their journey through the
      cook book. Bell and Jo could really make plain things very nicely, and
      were considered remarkable caterers by their admiring family of
      school-mates; but the dainties they had attempted were entirely beyond
      their powers; hence the pile of wasted goodies in the closet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear,&rdquo; sighed Lilia. &ldquo;Nobody has spoken a word for an age, and I
      don't wonder, if everybody is as tired as I. Shall we ever be rested
      enough to go to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking,&rdquo; said Edith, dreamily, &ldquo;that we have only seven more days
      to stay. If they were all to be as horrible as this, I shouldn't care very
      much; but we have had such fun, I dread to break up housekeeping. The
      chief trouble with to-day was that we did no planning yesterday. We never
      looked into the store-room nor bought anything in advance nor settled what
      we should cook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bell, waking up a little, &ldquo;we will crowd everything possible
      into the last week and make it a real carnival time. To-morrow is Saturday
      and the picnic; on Monday or Tuesday we'll have some sort of a 'pow-wow,'
      as Uncle Harry says, for the boys, in return for their invitation, and
      then we'll think of something perfectly grand and stupendous for Friday,
      our last day of fun. It will take from that until Monday to get the house
      into something like order for my mother's return. (This with a remorseful
      recollection of the terrible back bed-room, where everything imaginable
      had been 'dumped' for a week past.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't finished trimming our shade hats,&rdquo; called Alice, faintly, from
      the distance. &ldquo;I will do it in the morning while you are packing the
      luncheon. Whatever we do let us unpack our baskets privately and try to
      mix in our food with Mrs. Carter's or Mrs. Winship's, so that nobody will
      know which is which.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girls had tried to devise something jaunty, picturesque, and summery
      for a picnic costume; but the weather being too cold for a change of
      dress, they had only bought broad straw hats at the country store,&mdash;hats
      that farmers wore in haying time, with high crowns and wide brims. They
      had turned up one side of them coquettishly, and adorned it with funny
      silhouettes made of black paper, descriptive of their various adventures.
      Lilia's, for instance, had a huge ink bottle and sponge; Bell's a mammoth
      pie and frying-pan. Around the crowns they had tied colored scarfs of
      ribbon or gauze, interwoven with bunches of dried grasses, oats, and
      everlastings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-past eight found them all sleep-in as soundly as dormice; and the
      next morning with the recuperative power that youth brings, they awoke
      entirely refreshed and ready for the fray.
    </p>
    <p>
      The picnic was a glorious success. It was a clear, bright day, and not
      very cold; so that with a good fire they were able to have a couple of
      windows open, and to feel more as if they were out in the fresh air. The
      surprise and delight of the girls knew no bounds when they were ushered
      into their novel picnic ground, and even the older people avowed that they
      had never seen such a miracle of ingenuity. The scene was as pretty a one
      as can be imagined, though the young people little knew how lovely a
      picture they helped to make in the midst of their pastoral surroundings.
      Six charming faces they were, happy with girlish joy, sweet and bright
      from loving hearts, and pure, innocent, earnest living. Bell was radiant,
      issuing orders for the spread of the feast, flying here and there,
      laughing over a stuffed snake under a bush (Geoff's device), and talking
      merry nonsense with Hugh, her arch eyes shining with mischief under her
      great straw hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marcus Aurelius, the parrot, talked, and the canaries sang as if this were
      the last opportunity any of them ever expected to have; while the
      embroidered butterflies and stuffed birds fluttered and swayed and danced
      on the quivering tree-twigs beneath them almost as if they were alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The table-cloth was spread on the floor, in real picnic fashion, for the
      boys would allow neither tables nor chairs, and the lunch was simply
      delectable. Mrs. Win-ship, Mrs. Brayton, and Mrs. Pennell, with
      affectionate forethought, had brought everything that schoolgirls and boys
      particularly affect&mdash;jelly-cake, tarts, and hosts of other goodies.
      How the girls remembered their closetful of &ldquo;attempts&rdquo; at home; how they
      roguishly exchanged glances, yet never disclosed their failures; how they
      discoursed learnedly on baking-powder versus saleratus, raw potato versus
      boiled potato yeast; and with what dignity and assurance they discussed
      questions of household economy, and interlarded their conversation with
      quotations from the &ldquo;Young Housekeeper's Friend,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Bride's
      Manual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon they played all sorts of games,&mdash;some quiet, more
      not at all so,&mdash;until at five o'clock, nearly dark in these short
      days, they left their make-believe forest and trudged home through the
      snow, baskets under their arms, declaring it a mistaken idea that picnics
      should be confined to summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a gl-orious time we've had!&rdquo; exclaimed Jo, as they busied themselves
      about the home dining-room. &ldquo;Yesterday seems like a horrible nightmare,
      or, at least, it would if it hadn't happened in the daytime, and if we
      hadn't the pantry to remind us of the truth. The things we carried were
      not so v-e-r-y bad, after all! I was really proud of the buns, and Patty's
      doughnuts were as 'swelled up' as Mrs. Drayton's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a great deal yellower and spotted-er,&rdquo; quoth Edith, in a sly aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; admitted Patty, ruefully, &ldquo;there certainly was quite enough
      saleratus in them; but I think it very unbecoming in the maker of the
      bride's-cake to say anything about other people's mistakes! Bride's cake,
      indeed!&rdquo; she finished with a scornful smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True!&rdquo; said Edith, much crushed by this heartless allusion to what had
      been the most thorough and expensive failure of the day; &ldquo;I can't deny it.
      Proceed with your sarcasm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This house 'looks as if it was going to ride out'! as Miss Miranda says,&rdquo;
       exclaimed Alice. &ldquo;Do let us try to straighten it before Sunday! The
      closets are all in snarls, the kitchen's in a mess, and the less said
      about the back bedroom the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, inspired by Alice's enthusiasm, they began to work and to
      improve the hours like a whole hiveful of busy bees. They put on big
      aprons and washed pans and pots that had been evaded for two days, made
      fish-balls for breakfast, dusted, scrubbed, washed, mended, darned, and
      otherwise reduced the house to that especial and delicious kind of order
      which is likened unto apple-pie. And thus one week of the joys and trials
      of this merry half-a-dozen housekeepers was over and gone.

      CHAPTER V&mdash;OLD MAIDS AND YOUNG
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ONDAY morning
      broke. Such a cold, dismal, drizzly morning! The wind whistled and blew
      about the cottage, until Lilia suggested tying the clothes-line round the
      chimneys and fastening it to the strong pine-trees in front, for greater
      safety. It snowed at six o'clock, it hailed at seven, rained at eight,
      stopped at nine, and presently began to go through the same varied
      programme. After breakfast, Bell went to the window and stood dreamily
      flattening her nose against the pane, while the others busied themselves
      about their several tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, girls,&rdquo; said she at length, &ldquo;we've had four different kinds of
      weather this morning, so it may clear off after all, though I confess it
      doesn't look like it. It's too stormy to go anywhere, or for anybody to
      come to us, so we shall have to try violently in every possible way to
      amuse ourselves. I must run over to Miss Miranda's for the milk before it
      rains harder. Perhaps I shall stumble into some excitement on the way; who
      knows!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she ran out, and in a few minutes appeared in the yard wrapped
      in a bright red water-proof, the hood pulled over her head, and framing
      her roguish, rosy face. In ten minutes she returned breathless from a race
      across the garden, and a vain attempt to keep her umbrella right side out.
      She entered the room in her usual breezy way, leaving the doors all open,
      and sank into a chair, with an expression of mysterious mirth in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess what's happened!&rdquo; she asked, with sparkling eyes. &ldquo;I have the most
      enormous, improbable, unguessable surprise for you; you never will think,
      and anyway I can't wait to tell, so here it is: We are all invited to tea
      this afternoon with Miss Miranda and Miss Jane! Isn't that 'ridikilis'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do tell, Isabel,&rdquo; squeaked Jo, with a comically irreverent imitation of
      Miss Sawyer, &ldquo;air you a-going to accept?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, Bell, we'd better go,&rdquo; said Edith Lambert. &ldquo;I should like to see
      the inside of that old house. I dare say we shall enjoy it, and it saves
      cooking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are remarkably favored,&rdquo; laughed Bell. &ldquo;I don't believe that anybody
      has been invited there since the Sewing Circle met with them three years
      ago. They live such a quiet, strange, lonely life! Their mother and father
      died when they were very young, more than thirty years ago. They were
      quite rich for the times, and left their daughters this big house all
      furnished and quantities of lovely old-fashioned dishes and pictures. All
      the rooms are locked, but I'll try and melt Miss Miranda's heart, and get
      her to show us some of her relics. Scarcely anything has been changed in
      all these years, except that they have bought a cooking-stove. Miss Jane
      hates new-fangled things, and is really ashamed of the stove, I think; as
      to having a sewing-machine, or an egg-beater, or a carpet-sweeper,&mdash;why,
      she would as soon think of changing the fashion of her bonnet! I believe
      there isn't such a curious house, nor another pair of such dried-up,
      half-nice, half-disagreeable people in the country. There's Emma Jane with
      the butter! I'll meet her at the back door, get her to peel some potatoes
      and apples, make her sew a white ruffle in her neck, and make some
      original remark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bell's criticism of the Misses Sawyer and their home was quite just. The
      old brick house stood in a garden which, in the spring-time, was filled
      with odorous lilacs, blossoming apple-trees, and long rows of currant and
      gooseberry bushes. In the summer, too, there were actual groves of
      asparagus, gaudy sunflowers, bright hollyhocks, gay marigolds, royal
      flower-de-luce,&mdash;all respectable, old-fashioned posies, into whose
      hearts the humming-birds loved to thrust their dainty beaks and steal
      their sweetness. Then there were beds paved round with white clam-shells,
      where were growing trembling little bride's-tears, bachelor's-buttons,
      larkspur, and china pinks. No modern blossoms would Miss Miranda allow
      within these sacred ancient places, no begonias, gladioli, and &ldquo;sech,&rdquo;
       with their new-fangled, heathenish, unpronounceable names. The old flowers
      were good enough for her; and, certainly, they made a blooming spot about
      the dark house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, indeed, there was neither a leaf nor a bud to be seen; snow-birds
      perched and twittered on the naked apple-boughs, and rifts of snow lay
      over the sleeping seed-souls of the hollyhocks and marigolds, keeping them
      just alive and no more, in a freezing, cold-blooded sort of way common to
      snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the garden outside looked like a relic of the olden time, the rooms
      inside seemed even more so. The &ldquo;keeping-room&rdquo; had been refurnished
      fifteen or twenty years before, but so well had it been kept, that there
      still hovered about it a painful air of newness. Over the stiff black
      hair-cloth sofa hung a funeral wreath in a shell frame, surrounded by the
      Sawyer family photographs&mdash;husbands and wives always taken in
      affectionate attitudes, that their relations might never be misunderstood.
      In a corner stood the mahogany &ldquo;what-not&rdquo; with its bead watch-cases,
      shells, and glass globes covering worsted-work flowers, together with more
      family pictures, daguerreotypes in black cases on the top shelf, and a
      marvelous blue china vase holding peacock feathers. Then there was a
      gorgeous &ldquo;drawn in&rdquo; rug before the fireplace, with impossible purple roses
      and pink leaves on its surface, and a marble-topped table holding a
      magnificent lamp with a glass fringe around it, and a large piece of red
      flannel floating in the kerosene.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these glories the girls were allowed to view as a great favor granted
      at Bell's earnest request. They examined the parlor and the curiosities in
      the diningroom cupboard with awe-struck faces, though their sobriety was
      almost overcome at the sight of some of the works of art which Miss
      Miranda held up for their reverential admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upstairs there were rooms scarcely ever opened. The bedsteads were
      four-posted, and so high with many feather beds that their sleepy
      occupants must have ascended a step-ladder to get into them, or climbed up
      the posts hand over hand and dropped down into the downy depths. The
      counterpanes and comforters were quilted in wonderful patterns. There was
      the &ldquo;wild-goose chase,&rdquo; the &ldquo;log cabin,&rdquo; the &ldquo;rocky mountain,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Irish
      plaid,&rdquo; and a &ldquo;charm quilt,&rdquo; in twelve hundred pieces, no two of which
      were alike. The windows in the best chamber had white cotton curtains with
      elaborate fringes; the looking-glass was long and narrow with a
      yellow-painted frame, and a picture, in the upper half, of Napoleon
      crossing the Alps, the Alps in question being very pointed and of a
      sky-blue color, while Napoleon, in full-dress uniform, with never an
      outrider nor a guide, was galloping up and over the dizzy peaks on a
      skittish-looking pony.
    </p>
    <p>
      These things nearly upset Jo's gravity, and she quite lost Miss Sawyer's
      favor by coughing down an irrepressible giggle when she was shown a
      painting of Burns and His Mary, done in oil by Miss Hannah, the oldest
      sister of the family, and long since dead. Miss Sawyer had no doubt that
      Hannah's genius was of the highest order, although the specimens of her
      skill handed down would astonish a modern artist. Burns and His Mary were
      seated on a bank belonging to a landscape certainly not Scottish; His
      Mary, with a pink tarlatan dress on, tucked to the waist; while a brook
      was seemingly purling over Burns' coat-tails spread out behind him on the
      bank. It was this peculiar detail which aroused Jo's mirth, as well it
      might, so that she could not trust herself to examine with the others Miss
      Hannah's last and finest effort&mdash;&ldquo;Maidens welcoming General
      Washington in the streets of Alexandria.&rdquo; The maidens, thirteen in number,
      were precisely alike in form and feature, all very smooth as to hair, long
      as to waist, short as to skirt, pointed as to toe, and carrying bouquets
      of exactly the same size and structure, tied up with green ribbon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tour of inspection finished, the girls sat down to chat over their
      tatting and crochet work, while the two ladies went out to prepare supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My reputation is gone,&rdquo; whispered Jo, solemnly. &ldquo;To think that I should
      have laughed when I had been behaving so beautifully all the afternoon;
      but Robbie Burns was the last straw that broke the camel's back of my
      politeness; I couldn't have helped it if Miss Miranda had eaten me instead
      of frowning at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; cried Lilia, jumping up impulsively and knocking down
      her chair in so doing, &ldquo;I'm going to beard the lion in his den, and see if
      they won't let me help them get supper. Don't you want to come, Jo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two girls ran across the long, cold hall, opened the kitchen door
      stealthily, and Jo asked in her sweetest tones, &ldquo;Can't we set the table or
      help in any way, Miss Miranda?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I thank you, Josephine; there is nothing to do, or leastways you
      wouldn't know where things are, and wouldn't be any good. The Porter girl
      may come in if she wants to, but two of you would only clutter up the
      kitchen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Lilia went in meekly, and poor Jo flew back to the parlor, smarting
      under a bitter sense of disgrace. The sisters fortunately knew nothing of
      Lilia's aptitude for blunders, else she never would have been suffered to
      touch their precious household gods. As it was, by dint of extreme care,
      she managed to get the plum sauce on the table, and to set the chairs
      around it, without any serious disaster. To be sure, in cutting the dried
      beef, she notched a memorandum of the pieces shaved on each of her
      fingers, so that when she finished they were perfect little calendars of
      suffering; however, this only concerned herself, and she did not murmur,
      as most of her mistakes implicated other people.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past five they sat down to supper; and such a supper! Miss Miranda
      was evidently anxious to impress the young people. The best pink &ldquo;chany&rdquo;
       set had been unearthed, and there were besides other old dishes of great
      magnificence. Quaint British lustre pitchers held the milk and cream, a
      green dragon plate the cookies, and the &ldquo;Sheltered Peasant&rdquo; saucers came
      in for general admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The china was not more notable than the food. There were light soda
      biscuits, large in size and thick, and there was cold buttermilk bread; a
      blue and white bowl held tomato preserves, while a glass one was full of
      delicious applesauce cooked in maple-syrup; then there was a round, creamy
      cottage-cheese, white as a snow-ball; a golden, dried-pumpkin pie, baked
      in a deep yellow plate; the brownest and plummiest and indigestible-est of
      all plummy cakes, with doughnuts and sugar gingerbread besides. This array
      of good things being taken in with rapid and rabid glances, the girls
      exchanged involuntary looks of delight, and even emitted audible signs of
      happiness. To say that they did justice to the repast would be a feeble
      expression, for in truth the meals of their own preparation were irregular
      as to time, indifferent as to quality, and sometimes, when they calculated
      carelessly and unwisely, even small as to quantity.

    <p>
      After tea was over, each of the girls was required to give, in answer to a
      string of questions asked, her entire family history; for no tidbit of
      information concerning other people's affairs was uninteresting to Miss
      Jane or Miss Miranda. This cross-examination being finished, they rose to
      go, unable to hear any longer the quiet, proper, suppressed atmosphere
      that pervaded the house. While they had been admiring the quaint,
      old-fashioned relics and busy devouring the appetizing New England
      goodies, they were quite at ease, but an hour or two of conversation had
      exhausted their adaptability. When they had taken their leave, and the
      sound of their merry voices and ringing laughter floated in from the
      country road, Miss Miranda sank into a chair, and waved a fan excitedly to
      and fro, her mouse-colored complexion quite flushed and pink from the
      unwonted dissipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wall, Jane,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;it's over now, and we've done our dooty by Mis'
      Winship; she's a good neighbor, and I wanted to act right by Isabel when
      her Ma was away, but of all the crazy, 'stivering' girls I ever see, them
      do beat all; though they did behave tolerable well this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They seemed to enjoy their supper,&rdquo; said Miss Jane; &ldquo;I never saw girls
      make a heartier meal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They did for certain,&rdquo; continued Miranda, &ldquo;too hearty most. I thought.
      That light-haired girl with the blue ear-rings left her meat hash, that'll
      sour before we can warm it over again, and et and et fruit cake till I was
      afraid she'd have fits at the table. We ought to be very thankful we
      hevn't any young ones or men-folks to cook for, Jane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with that expression of gratitude on her lips, she lighted a candle,
      and after locking up the house securely, the two spinsters went to their
      bedrooms to sleep the sleep of the calm and the virtuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their merry visitors, undisturbed by the pelting rain from above, and the
      deep &ldquo;slush&rdquo; beneath, waded over into their own grounds with many a hearty
      laugh and jest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how delightful our own sitting-room looks!&rdquo; exclaimed Patty, as they
      opened the door and gathered about the cheerful fire on the hearth. And,
      indeed, it did, after the stiff, prim arrangement of the rooms they had
      left. The flickering blaze cast soft shadows on the walls, and touched the
      marbles on the brackets with rosy tints; the canary-birds were fast asleep
      with their heads hidden under their wings, and the dog and cat were
      snoozing peacefully together on the hearth-rug. The young people, as well
      as the room, belonged to another generation than Miss Miranda's and Miss
      Jane's, a brighter, freer, fresher one, with a wider outlook, and quite
      different problems and responsibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We never can be jollier than this!&rdquo; cried Lilia, in an irrepressible
      burst of appreciation. &ldquo;Oh, that it might last forever, and that
      seminaries for young ladies might be turned into zoological gardens! Then
      we could keep house here this week, the next week, and eternally, taking
      tea with Miss Miranda whenever she asked us to come. What a good supper
      that was, girls! Oh, Bell and Jo, you ought to be overcome with remorse
      when you think what you might give us to eat, if you were only skillful,
      energetic, and ingenious!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're the very essence of thanklessness!&rdquo; answered Bell, in high
      dudgeon. &ldquo;It's nothing less than fiery martyrdom to cook for you girls,
      when you are so ungrateful. Your special seminary will not be so far
      removed from a zoological garden when <i>you</i> return to it, that is
      certain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child, I am sorry already for my remark,&rdquo; said Lilia, in feigned
      repentance. &ldquo;It was very thoughtless in me to arouse your anger until
      after the next meal. Any impertinence of ours is sure to be visited upon
      us in the form of oatmeal porridge, or salt fish and crackers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lilia Porter, if you want to be an angel by and by, it would be better to
      draw your thoughts away from eatables for a time; you talk quite too much
      about food,&rdquo; said Edith Lambert, who had a very hearty appetite, but never
      called attention to it. &ldquo;When you have done with your nonsense, I have
      something to propose for our final 'good time.' We have only four days, 'tis
      true, and 'pity 'tis 'tis true; but we must go away with
      flying colors, and so astonish the natives with our genius that the
      village will talk of us for months to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Si-lence in court!&rdquo; cried Jo, impressively. &ldquo;Let me offer you the coal
      hod for a platform; it won't tip over; go on, you look as dignified as a
      policeman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop your nonsense, Jo. You remember, Bell, the evening when we made a
      comic pantomime of 'Young Lochinvar,' and acted it before the teachers and
      seniors?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I do,&rdquo; laughed Bell, in recollection. &ldquo;We girls took all the
      characters. What fun it was!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why can't we do that again, changing and improving it, of course? The
      boys are so clever and bright about anything of the kind that they would
      be irresistibly funny. What do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like the idea,&rdquo; exclaimed Patty Weld. &ldquo;Uncle Harry's large hall would
      be just the place for it, and the stage is already there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is; how fortunate,&rdquo; agreed Alice; &ldquo;we couldn't think of anything
      that would be greater fun. How shall we cast the characters! You must be
      the bride, Bell, the 'fair Ellen!' you will do it better than anybody. Jo
      will make up into the funniest old lady for a mother, and the rest of us
      can be the bride-maidens. Hugh Pennell will be a glorious Young Lochinvar,
      if he can be persuaded to run away with Bell&mdash;&rdquo; this with a sly
      glance at her hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Edith, &ldquo;and poor Jack will have to be the 'craven bridegroom,'
      who loses his bride, and Geoff, the stern parent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Harry will read the poem for us, I know,&rdquo; continued Bell; &ldquo;he does
      that sort of thing often at the church, and does it beautifully. Phil
      Howard, Royal Lawrence, and Harry will be bridemen. We'll perform the
      piece in such a tragic way that each separate hair in the audience will
      stand erect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, oh, the labor of it, girls!&rdquo; sighed Patty&mdash;&ldquo;wooden horses to be
      made for the elopement scene, Scottish dresses, and all sorts of toggery
      to be hunted up; can we ever do it in time, with our house-cleaning before
      us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, of course we can,&rdquo; rejoined Bell, energetically. &ldquo;We will
      consult every book on private theatricals, Scottish history, manners, and
      costumes in this house, and Uncle Harry's, too. Let us get up at five
      to-morrow morning, have a simple breakfast of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cornmeal mush or dry bread and milk,&rdquo; finished Lilia, with grim sarcasm.
      &ldquo;If time must be saved, of course, it must come out of the cooking! How
      are we to do this amount of work on a low diet, I should like to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are the cooks to get time for anything outside the kitchen if they
      humor your unnatural appetites! Out of kindness, we propose to lower you
      gradually, meal by meal, into the pit of boarding-school fare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.' I don't care to be starved
      beforehand by way of getting used to it,&rdquo; retorted Lilia, as she lighted
      the bedroom candles. &ldquo;Come, dears, do cover the fire; it was sleepy-time
      an hour ago, and if you want to see something beautiful, look through the
      piazza window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beneath them lay the steep river bank, smooth with its white, glittering
      crust, above which a few naked alders pushed their snow-weighted
      finger-tips; one rugged old pine-tree stood in the garden, grand, dark,
      and fearless; the quiet part of the river had been turned by King Winter
      into an icy mirror; but over the dam a hundred yards below, the waters
      tumbled too furiously to be frozen. The old bridge looked like a silver
      string tying together the two little villages, and over all was the
      dazzling winter moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six dreamy faces now at the cottage window. Six girlish figures, all drawn
      closely together, with arms lovingly clasped. The white beauty, and the
      solemn stillness of the picture hushed them into quietness. One minute
      passed and then another, while the spell was working, till at length Bell
      impulsively bent her brown head, and said softly: &ldquo;If the minister were
      here he would say, 'Let us pray.' It makes me want to whisper, 'Dear Lord,
      make us pure and white within, as thy world is without.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; murmured Edith and Patty, in the same breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pull down the curtain,&rdquo; sighed Jo; &ldquo;it makes me feel wicked!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, don't, don't, not quite yet!&rdquo; pleaded Edith, &ldquo;it is too heavenly and
      it can't do us any harm to feel wicked. It reminds me of Tennyson's 'St.
      Agnes' Eve,' of the white, white picture she looked out upon from her
      convent window the night she was lifted to the golden doors of heaven&mdash;the
      poem you recited for the medal, Alice,&mdash;say a verse of it.&rdquo; And
      Alice, half under her breath, repeated the lovely lines:
    </p>

    <p class="indent20">

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>N the next
      morning, and, indeed, on all of those left of their stay, the six
      housekeepers were up at an alarmingly early hour, so that the sun,
      accustomed to being the earliest of all risers, felt himself quite
      behindhand and outshone.
    </p>
    <p>
      In vain he clambered up over the hillside in a desperate hurry; the girls
      were always before him with lighted candles. As for the clock, it held up
      its hands with astonishment, and struck five shrill exclamation points of
      surprise to see six wide-awake young persons tumbling out of their warm
      nests before the world was lighted or heated.

      The day's hours were hardly enough for the day's plans, for there were
      farewell coasting, skating, and sleighing parties, besides active daily
      preparations for the pantomime. The costumes of the hoys were gorgeous to
      behold, and were fashioned entirely by the girls' clever fingers. They
      consisted of scarlet or blue flannel shirts, short plaid kilts, colored
      stockings striped with braid, sashes worn over shoulders, and jaunty
      little caps with bobbing quills.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the last happy evening of their stay, the eventful evening of &ldquo;Young
      Lochinvar,&rdquo; the guests gathered from all the surrounding country to see
      the frolic. There were people from North Edgewood, South Edgewood, East
      Edge-wood, and West Edgewood; from Edgewood Upper Corner, Edgewood Lower
      Corner, and Edgewood Four Corners, and everybody had brought his uncles
      and cousins.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the big dressing-room the young actors were assembled,&mdash;and
      fortunately in a high state of exuberance and excitement, else they would
      have been decidedly frightened at the ordeal before them. Jo, mirror in
      hand, was trying to make herself look seventy; and, though she had not
      succeeded, she had transformed herself into a very presentable Scottish
      dame, with her short satin gown and apron, lace kerchief and spectacles.
      Edith was giving a pair of pointed burnt-cork eyebrows to Hugh, that he
      might wear a sufficiently dashing and defiant countenance for Lochinvar,
      while Jack stood before the glass practicing his meek expression for the
      jilted bridegroom.

      Bell had sunk into a chair, and folded her hands to &ldquo;get up&rdquo; her courage.
      As to her dress, nobody knew whether it was the proper one for a Scottish
      bride or not; but it was the only available thing, and certainly she
      looked in it a very bewitching and sufficient excuse for Lochinvar's rash
      folly. It was of some shining white material, and came below the ankle,
      just showing a pair of jaunty high-heeled slippers; the skirt was
      'broidered and flounced to the belt, the waist simple and full, with short
      puffed sleeves; while a bridal veil and dainty crown of flowers made her
      as winsome and bonny as a white Scottish rose. Emma Jane Perkins stood in
      one corner paralyzed by her own good looks. Her red hair was waved and
      hanging in her neck, and her dress was white. She hoped she could be
      trusted to bring in this overpowering weight of beauty at the right
      moment, but felt a little doubtful.

      Uncle Harry stumbled in at the low door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ready, young fry?&rdquo; asked he. &ldquo;It is half-past seven, and we ought
      to begin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put out the footlights, give the people back their money, and tell them
      the prima donna is dangerously ill!&rdquo; gasped Bell, faintly, fanning herself
      with a box-cover. &ldquo;I don't believe I can ever do it. Hugh, are you
      perfectly sure our horse won't break down on the stage when we elope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Calm yourself, 'fair Ellen,' and trust to my horsemanship. Doesn't the
      poem say:

      &ldquo;And doesn't this exactly embody Scott's idea?&rdquo;&mdash;pointing to a wild
      and cross-eyed wooden effigy mounted on a pair of trucks.

      You have all read Sir Walter Scott's poem of &ldquo;Young Lochinvar,&rdquo; and many a
      time, I hope, for they are brave old verses:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Oh, young Lochinvar is come out of the

    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Through all the wide Border his steed
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      was the best,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And, save his good broadsword, he
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      weapons had none;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He rode all unarmed, and he rode all
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      alone.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So faithful in love, and so dauntless in
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      war,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      There never was knight like the young

    <p class="indent30">
      Lochinvar.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, you remember, the young knight rode fast and far, stayed not for
      brakes, stopped not for stones, but all in vain; for ere he alighted at
      Netherby Gate, the fair Ellen, overcome by parental authority, had
      consented to be married to another:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For a laggard in love and a dastard in
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      war
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Was to wed the fair Ellen of brave
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Lochinvar.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But he, nothing daunted, boldly entered the bridal hall among bridemen and
      bridemaids and kinsmen, thereby raising so general a commotion that the
      bride's father cried at once, the poor craven bridegroom being struck
      quite dumb:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Oh, come ye in peace here, or coyne ye
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      inivar,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Or to dance at our bridal, young Lord
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Lochinvar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The lover answers with apparent indifference that though he has in past
      times been exceedingly fond of the young person called Ellen, he has now
      merely come to tread a measure and drink one cup of wine with her, for
      although love swells like the tide, it ebbs like it also. So he drinks her
      health, while she sighs and blushes, weeps and smiles, alternately; then
      he takes her soft hand, her parents fretting and fuming the while, and
      leads the dance with her,&mdash;he so stately, she so lovely, that they
      are the subject of much envy, admiration, and sympathy. But while thus
      treading the measure, he whispers in her ear something to which she
      apparently consents without much unwillingness, and at the right moment
      they dance out from the crowd of kinsmen to the door of the great hall,
      where in the darkness the charger stands ready saddled. Quick as thought
      the dauntless lover swings his fair Ellen lightly up, springs before her
      on the saddle, and they dash furiously away:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;She is won! We are gone, over ban,
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      bush, and scaur;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      They'll have fleet steeds that follow
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      quoth young Lochinvar.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as their flight is discovered, there is wild excitement and hasty
      mounting of all the Netherby Clan; there is racing and chasing over the
      fields, but &ldquo;the laggard in love and the dastard in war&rdquo; never recovers
      his lost Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So daring in love, and so dauntless in
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      war,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Have ye e'er heard of gallant like
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      young Lochinvar?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Harry read the poem through in such a stirring way that the audience
      was fairly warmed into interest; then, standing by the side of the stage
      with the curtain rolled up, he read it again, line by line, or verse by
      verse, to explain the action.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the first stanza, Lochinvar made his triumphal entrance, riding a
      prancing hobby-horse with a sweeping tail of raveled rope, and a mane to
      match, gorgeous trappings adorned with sleigh-bells and ornamental paper
      designs, and bunches of cotton tacked on for flecks of foam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lochinvar himself wore gray pasteboard armor, a pair of carpet slippers
      with ferocious spurs, red mittens, and carried a huge carving-knife. His
      costume alone was food for amusement, but the manner in which he careered
      wildly about the stage, displaying his valorous horsemanship as he rode to
      the wedding, was perfectly irresistible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next scene opened in Netherby Hall, showing the bridal party all
      assembled in gala dress. Into this family gathering presently strode the
      determined lover, with his carving-knife sheathed for politeness' sake.
      Then followed a comical pantomime between the angry parents, who demanded
      his intentions, and the adroit Lochinvar, who declared them to be
      peaceful. The father (Geoffrey Strong) at last gave him unwilling
      permission to drink one cup of wine and tread one measure with the bride.
      She kissed the goblet (a tin quart measure), he quaffed off the spirit,
      and threw down the cup. Pair Ellen bridled with pleasure, and promenaded
      about the room on his arm, while the bridegroom looked on wretchedly, the
      parents quarreled, and the bride-maidens whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      &ldquo;'Tivere better by far
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To have matched our fair cousin with
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      young Lochinvar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first opportunity, the guests walked leisurely out, and young
      Lochinvar seized an imaginary chance to draw Ellen hastily back into the
      supper room. He whispered the magic word into her ear, she started in
      horror and drew back; he urged; she demurred; he pleaded; she showed signs
      of surrender; he begged on his bended knees; she yielded at length to the
      plan of the elopement, with all its delightful risks. Then Lochinvar
      darted to the outside door and brought in his charger,&mdash;rather an
      unique proceeding, perhaps, but necessary under the circumstances,
      inasmuch as the audience could not be transported to the proper scene of
      the mounting. As the flight was to be made on horseback, much ingenuity
      and labor were needed to arrange it artistically. The horse's head was the
      work of Geoff's hand, and for meekness of expression, jadedness,
      utterly-cast-down-and-worn-out-ness, it stood absolutely unrivalled. A
      pair of trucks were secreted beneath the horse-blankets, and the front
      legs of the animal pranced gaily out in front, taking that startling and
      decided curve only seen in pictures of mowing-machines and horseraces.
      Lochinvar quieted his fiery beast, and swung Ellen into the saddle, leaped
      up after her, waved his tall hat in triumph, and started off at a snail's
      pace, the horse being dragged by a rope from behind the scenes. When half
      way across the stage, Ellen clasped her lover's arm and seemed to have
      forgotten something. Everybody in the room at once guessed it must be some
      part of her trousseau. She explained earnestly in pantomime; Lochinvar
      refused to return; she insisted; he remained firm; she pouted and
      seemingly said that she wouldn't elope at all unless she could have her
      own way. He relented, they went back to Netherby Hall, and Ellen ran up a
      secret stairway and came down laden with maidenly traps. Greatly to the
      merriment of the observers, she loaded them on the docile horse in the
      very face of Lochinvar's displeasure&mdash;two small looking-glasses, a
      bird-cage, and a French bonnet. She then leisurely drew on a pair of huge
      India rubbers, unfurled a yellow linen umbrella, and just as her lover's
      patience was ebbing, suffered herself to be remounted. The second trip
      across the stage was accomplished in safety, though with anything but the
      fleetness common to elopements either in life or in poetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the pursuit&mdash;a most graphic and stirring scene, giving
      large opportunities to the supernumerary characters. Four bridemen on
      dashing hobbyhorses, jumping fences, leaping bars and ditches in hot
      excitement; four bride-maids, with handkerchiefs tied over their heads,
      running hither and thither in confusion; the old mother and father,
      limping in and straining their eyes for a sight of their refractory
      daughter; and last of all, poor Jack, the deserted bridegroom, on foot,
      with never a horse left to him, puffing and panting in his angry chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was done! How people laughed till they cried, how they continued to
      laugh for five minutes afterward, I cannot begin to tell you. The
      performance had been the perfection of fun from first to last, and seemed
      all the more inspiring because it was original with the bright bevy of
      young folks who had enacted the poem. Uncle Harry had renewed his youth,
      and received the plaudits of the crowd with unconcealed pleasure. The hero
      and heroine, Lochinvar and fair Ellen, had so generously provided dramatic
      opportunities for the minor actors that all had enjoyed an equal chance in
      the favor of the audience. There was neither envy, jealousy, nor
      heartburning; each of the girls gloried in the achievements of the others,
      and confessed that the mechanical ingenuity of the boys had made the
      triumph possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the lights were all out, the finery bundled up, the many
      farewells said, and as the girls, escorted by their faithful young
      squires, trudged along the path through the orchard for the last time, sad
      thoughts would come, although the party was much too youthful and cheery
      to be gloomy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depart, fun and frolic!&rdquo; sighed Lilia, in mournful tones. &ldquo;Depart,
      breakfasts at any hour and other delights of laziness! Enter,
      boarding-school, books, bells, and other banes of existence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is really too awful to think or to speak about,&rdquo; sighed Jo. &ldquo;Now I
      know how Eve must have felt when she had to pack up and leave the garden;
      only she went because she insisted upon eating of the tree of knowledge,
      while I must go and eat, whether I will or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your appetite for that special fruit isn't so great that you'll ever be
      troubled with indigestion,&rdquo; dryly rejoined Patty, the student of the
      &ldquo;Jolly Six.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fancy starting off at half-past ten to-morrow morning; fancy reaching
      school at one, and sitting down stupidly to a dinner of broth, fried
      liver, and cracker-pudding! Ugh! it makes me shiver,&rdquo; said Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of us,&rdquo; cried Geoff, &ldquo;going back to college, and settling into
      regular 'digs.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If 'digs' is a contraction of dignitaries,&rdquo; said Edith, saucily, &ldquo;you'll
      never be those; if you mean you are to delve into the mines of learning,
      that's doubtful, too; but if it's a corruption of Digger Indian, I should
      say there might be some force in your remark. Oh, what matchless
      war-whoops you gave in the pursuit to-night. Every separate hair in Betty
      Bean's head stood on end, and the Misses Sawyer sat close together and
      trembled visibly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a wonderful evening,&rdquo; remarked Hugh. &ldquo;There were persons there who
      said that Bell was beautiful and I was clever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to annoy you,&rdquo; laughed Jo, &ldquo;but I heard exactly the
      opposite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which only goes to show that both of us are both,&rdquo; retorted Bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that sentence goes to show that a week's absence from the class in
      parsing and analysis has had its effect,&rdquo; said Patty. &ldquo;Look at our angel
      cottage, girls! Doesn't it look like a marble night-lamp with the hall
      light shining through all its sweet little windows'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fire isn't out, that's fortunate,&rdquo; observed Alice, as she saw a small
      cloud of smoke issuing from the chimney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night and sweet dreams,&rdquo; called the hoys, when Geoffrey had unlocked
      the door of the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweet dreams, indeed!&rdquo; the girls answered in chorus. &ldquo;The kitchen closet
      to put in order, also the shed, two trunks to pack, twenty-four hours'
      dishes to wash, and a million 'odd jobs' more or less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't forget the borrowed articles to be returned,&rdquo; reminded Hugh. &ldquo;We'll
      take the pung and do that for you, also attend to the cleaning of the
      shed, which is more in our line than yours. Boys, let us give one rousing
      cheer for Dr. and Mrs. Winship, the model parents of the century!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The welkin rang with hurrahs, in which the girls joined with hearty vigor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now another rousing one for the model daughter of the century,&rdquo; cried
      Bell, modestly; &ldquo;the model daughter who had the bright idea and begged the
      model parents to assent to it. Of what use would have been the model
      parents, pray, unless they had had the model daughter with the bright
      idea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      More cheers, lustier than ever, floated out into the orchard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The model daughter would have had a dull house-party with nothing but her
      bright idea to keep her company,&rdquo; said Jo Fenton, suggestively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three cheers for the house party! Three cheers for the 'Jolly Six!' Hip,
      hip, hurrah!&rdquo; and at this moment Uncle Harry's window opened and across
      the breadth of the orchard came the warning note of a conch shell, an
      instrument of much power, with which Uncle Harry called his men to dinner
      in haying time. Had it not been for this message of correction it is
      possible the enthusiastic young people might have cheered one another till
      midnight.

      It was afternoon of the next day. The six little housekeepers were gone,
      and the dejected hoys went into the garden to take a last look at the
      empty cottage. On the door was a long piece of fluttering white paper,
      tied with black ribbon. It proved to be the parting words of the &ldquo;Jolly

      The boys read this nonsense with hearty laughter, and latching the gate
      behind them, they went off, leaving the place deserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are awfully jolly girls,&rdquo; said Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better than jolly,&rdquo; added Geoffrey, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're right, Geoff; miles better and miles more than jolly,&rdquo; agreed
      Hugh. &ldquo;None like'em in Brunswick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or in Portland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or in Bath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or in Augusta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with this outburst of respectful admiration the lads passed out of
      view.
    </p>
    <p>
      The setting sun shone rosily in at the piazza window that afternoon, but
      fell blankly against a gray curtain, instead of smiling into six laughing
      faces as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      A noisy crowd of sparrows settled on the bare branches over the door-step,
      twittering as if they expected the supper of bread-crumbs which girlish
      hands had been wont to throw them, and at last flew away disappointed. In
      the old house opposite, Miss Miranda sat in her high-backed chair,
      knitting as fiercely as ever, while Miss Jane was at her post by the
      window, drearily watching the sun go down.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned away with the glow of a new thought in her wrinkled face.
      &ldquo;Mi-randy!&rdquo; called she, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      No answer but the sharp click of knitting-needles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mirandy Sawyer! What do you say to invitin' our niece, Hannah, down here
      from the farm, and givin' her a couple of terms' schoolin'? Aurelia has
      her hands full raisin' that great family of children. She'd be glad one of
      'em should have some advantages. We ain't seen Hannah since she was
      ten, but she was a nice appearin', pretty behavin' girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miranda glanced ont of the window without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems like a streak of sunshine had gone out o' the place with them
      young creeters, and I think we've lived here alone about long enough!&rdquo;
       continued Miss Jane. &ldquo;I should like to give one girl a chance of being a
      brighter, livelier woman than I am. Yes, you may drop your knittin',
      Mirandy, but you know it as well as I do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No wonder that Miss Miranda looked very much as if she had been struck by
      lightning; the more wonder that the quiet old house didn't shake to its
      foundation, when this proposal was made. Indeed, old Tabby, on the
      hearth-rug, did wake up, startled, no doubt by the consciousness that a
      child's hand might pull her tail in days to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does seem dreadful lonesome,&rdquo; Miss Miranda agreed, after a long pause.
      &ldquo;Hear Topsy howling in the kitchen; she's missin' the young life that's
      gone, and she'll have to git used to us all over again, jest as I said.
      Hannah would be considerable expense to us, and make a sight o' work, too.
      Of course, you've thought o' that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We take about so many steps, anyway,&rdquo; argued Miss Jane, &ldquo;and if the
      child's spry and handy, she may save us a few now and then. Tabitha ain't
      so much care, nor near so confinin', sence Topsy came to keep her comp'ny&mdash;even
      two cats is better'n one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There goes Emma Jane Perkins,&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Miranda, from her post of
      observation. &ldquo;She looks different somehow. I've always said I should think
      her face would ache, it's so hombly, but I guess she's passed her
      hombliest, and is going to improve. Mebbe Mis' Perkins has been givin' her
      spring medicine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess the 'spring medicine' has been two weeks' good time with that
      trainin' and careerin' houseful of girls,&rdquo; rejoined Miss Jane, wisely.
      &ldquo;Everybody in the village sits up kind o' smart and looks as if they'd
      taken a tonic. Maybe I'd better write to Aurelia on Sunday, Mirandy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebbe you had, Jane, and if she can't spare Hannah, say we'll take
      Rebecca, though I always thought she was a self-willed child, too full of
      her own fancies to be easy managed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This is not the time for Rebecca's story; but, as a matter of fact, Mrs.
      Aurelia Randall could not spare Hannah, who was docile, industrious, and
      of much assistance with the house-work, and as a matter of fact it was the
      somewhat dreaded Rebecca who did come from the far-away farm to live in
      the dull old house with Miss Jane and Miss Miranda. And all that befell
      this new family circle, formed almost by accident, and all that Rebecca
      did, or became, as well as everything that happened during the gradual
      beautifying of Emma Jane Perkins, was, as you see, the indirect result of
      Bell Winship's madcap experiment in housekeeping.

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
